# Fractals
This project, for CSC 144 at Cornell College, was an attempt to draw an image of a piece of the Mandelbrot Set. The program creates a window and draws a piece of the set going from -1 to -0.8 on the real plane and 0.22 to 0.35 on the imaginary plane. The program can be easily adjusted to draw other parts of the Mandelbrot set and includes a fully functional complex number class which has additional unused features. I experiemented with drawing both Julia and Mandelbrot Set images and evenatually settled on working with a twisitng piece of the Mandelbrot Set. The piece of the set I focused on looked a lot like lightning so for coloring I created a piecewise gradient coloring method which makes the image look like a stormy day. 

One issue I had during this project was understanding coloring and creating gradient functions to flow from one color to another. This led to me spending a lot of time experimenting with different parabolic and linear functions on the red, green, and blue color components before reaching the final image. Another issue that arose had to do with my Git repository, in which I mistakenly added several other projects that I eventually had to remove en masse. Despite these issues, overall, the experience of creating this image was much easier thanks to my experience in earlier projects in this class. 

To see what the final window of this program looks like, see the Lightning Fractal.PNG file in this project.
